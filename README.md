# Re-Craft-3DS
a Minecraft (1.10.x - 1.12.x) client implemented on the 3DS (and new 3DS)

### Other informations
This is a hobby project. I cannot tell how far this will go in the future but for now this will stay active for a longer amount of time.
I wish for other devs that may code with me, so this project can become bigger, like up to recent minecraft versions, proper authentications and more

Please dont be annoyed if this crashed on your device, as this is my first proper c++ lang and 3DS hardware project

### Additional libraries (you need to install them in order to build this project)

- 3ds-zlib
